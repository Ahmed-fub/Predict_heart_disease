# Predict heart disease using Machine learning 

supervision classification problem to predict the presence of heart disease depend on some features 

## Data 
Heart Disease Data Set from UCI 

### Features

There are 14 attributes :
1. age : age in years
2. sex : sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. cp :chest pain type
* Value 1: typical angina
* Value 2: atypical angina
* Value 3: non-anginal pain
* Value 4: asymptomatic
4. trestbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) 
5. chol : serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. restecg : esting electrocardiographic results
* Value 0: normal
* Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
* Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
8. thalach :  maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang :  exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak :  ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* Value 1: upsloping
* Value 2: flat
* Value 3: downsloping
12. ca :  number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal :  thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14. num : (the predicted attribute) 

# Machine Learning Models 
1. Decision Tree
2. Logistic Regression
